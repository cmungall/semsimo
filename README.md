# SemSimO

An ontology for classifying semantic similarity measures

## Status

pre-alpha

## Use Cases

 * Internal and external documentation of tools
 * Classification of tools
 * Understanding tools and methods: e.g. ask a query "which methods are prone to annotation bias"?

## Future development

Currently developed as a distinct ontology whilst in alpha
phase. Should be merged into larger ontology? Note: IRIs may not be
stable
